Some of the key ideas from the course Inroduction to HTML and CSS

    HTML describes the structure and semantic content of a document.
    The structure and semantic content of a HTML document is tagged with
    HTML Elements such as <head> <title> <p> <div> <section>.
    The structure of a document is like an inverted tree with the <html>
    element being the root of the document.

    A web page is essentially a collection of boxes laid 
        out next to and on top of each other.
    CSS describes how each element of the tree should be presented.
